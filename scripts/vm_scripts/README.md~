VIRTUAL MACHINE SCRIPTS
========================================================
TODO - what is virtual machine and why scripts are needed?

While writing a program for NAO user is utilising a cross compilation method. Source code has to be compiled and built on virtual machine and then sent to NAO robot.

List of scripts
------------
* vm_send_packages_nao.sh - sends to NAO with a given ip address archived workspaces (ws_ros - built ROS, ws_ros_additional_packages - built additional external packages/libraries that are needed to be downloaded by NAO, ws_rapp_nao - built core agent) ready to use on NAO robot. It also sends data structure to launch voicemail. Moreover it connects to NAO robot and extracts archived files, preparing NAO file structure.
* vm_archive_workspaces.sh - archives workspaces
* vm_compile_additional_packages.sh - builds packages from ws_ros workspace (if not compiled). Downloads external libraries (gsasl, vmime), needed ROS packages (bond_core, cmake_modules, image_common, nodelet_core, vision_opencv, rosbridge_suite) and installs/builds them into /home/nao/ws_ros_additional_packages/install_isolated/
* vm_compile_rapp_workspaces.sh - builds ROS packages from ws_rapp_nao and ws_rapp_applications_nao
* vm_preparation_to_build_packages.sh - clones github repositories (https://github.com/rapp-project/rapp-robot-nao.git and https://github.com/rapp-project/rapp-applications.git from master branch), creates correct file structure on virtual machine.
* vm_ros_tutorial.sh - script that can be useful for passing a (ROS Installation on VM for Nao) Tutorial. Please note that if you get a correct virtual machine image than you get there a ROS packages ready to build.
